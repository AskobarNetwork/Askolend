contract deployment steps:

clone repo(youve obviously done that if your reading this)

cd to AskoLend-contracts

run npm install

run: truffle migrate --network kovan

This migration auto-magically whitelists the FakeLink and FakeAugur
MoneyMarketInstances as well as their associated AHR and ARL tokens

if you need some Fake-Augur or Fake-Link feel free to shoot me your address and i will send you some. you will need some of each to test
