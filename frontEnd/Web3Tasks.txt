This txt file is ment to document what tasks need to be done to handle front end web3 integration for the AskoLend project

TASKS SUPPLY SIDE:

 need to add IERC20 approve function calls for end user to approve the contract to withdraw
 an asset from them(suggest setting the withdraw amount to something insanely large like 1000000000000000000000000000000
 so this only needs to be done once per asset for the end user) to SupplyMarketTable.tsx.

 need to add lendToAHRpool() and lendToALRpool() contract calls to a MoneyMarketInstance in the SupplyMarketTable.tsx component.

 need to add balanceOf() function calls to AskoRiskToken contracts for both high and low for each asset as well as a getCash() function call to each of these ART's
 to retreive their asset balance

TASKS BORROW SIDE:

 need to add borrow() function call that inputs the amount to borrow and the address of the users collateralized ALR tokens(address of the token contract)

 need to add call to ART contract(s) for an asset to accountBorrows() to return a Borrow Snapshot for the user showing their current borrow values

 need to call borrowIndex() to calculate current interest rates for each assets

TASKS COLLATERALIZE SIDE:

 need to be able to call collateralizeALR() from an assets MoneyMarketInstance in the CollateralDailog.tsk component

 need to call collateralTracker() from the MoneyMarketControl contract for each assets money market for a user

TASKS REDEEM ARTs:

need a component for user to redeem their Asko Risk Tokens back for their collateral(not sure if there is a component for this yet)
